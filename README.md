# Udacity Project 3 - Classic Arcade Game
These are the files for the third project in Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.  All of the code was written by me (Jonathan Sexton) unless otherwise stated.

The live, playable game can be found [here]().

# Project Design
I wanted to customize the game, but I feel I am too far behind in the course work to spend anymore time on this project.  I will go back and add more features when time allows.
